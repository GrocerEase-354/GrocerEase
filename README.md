# GrocerEase
GrocerEase is a project created for our CMPT 354 class. This project aimed to further our knowledge about databases and SQL, while at the same time served as a learning experience for the Flask web framework. 

The languages used in this project are Python Flask, Jinja2 as the web template engine, and SQL for the database. MySQL was the database management system used in GrocerEase.

## Instructions ##
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
* Make sure to adjust the app.config SQL variables in `top.py` to match your MySQL DB login credentials.
* Ensure that you've imported dump.sql into your MySQL DB.
* After installing all dependencies, run `top.py` with your machine's corresponding Python verion.
